# MSF Phantom QA

Analysis software for X-ray scans of the MSF 3D-printed QA phantom.

Upload a DICOM scan, confirm what the program detected in a step-by-step
wizard, and get reproducible QA metrics with full traceability — plus reports,
exports and trend comparison across phantoms and sites.

It implements the tests of the *MSF X-ray QA phantom acquisition and analysis
guide*:

| Test | Metric |
|---|---|
| Spatial resolution | Standard deviation per line-pair group, plus measured line pitch and per-line residuals |
| Low contrast | CNR for each of 8 circles |
| Uniformity | SNR per square and ΔSNR against the scan's own mean |
| Dynamic range | Mean per wedge step, monotonicity and dynamic-range ratio |
| X-ray / light field alignment | Field-edge deviation from each side's central line, in mm and % of SID |
| Dimensions | Corner-mark distances and side-ruler pitch |

**No material assumptions are made.** Wedge steps and low-contrast circles are
identified by position and design order only; every reported value is a direct
measurement.

Every test reports **why** it passed, warned or failed — the measured value, the
limit it was compared against, and where to correct it — so a result can be
acted on rather than merely recorded.

## Requirements

Python 3.11 or later. Install dependencies:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running locally

```bash
python run_app.py                 # then open http://127.0.0.1:8777
```

Everything runs on your machine; no internet connection is used.

```bash
python -m pytest tests -q         # test suite

# headless batch analysis, without the verification steps
python -m phantom_qa.cli "path/to/DICOMFILE" --out qa_output --sid 1000
```

## Running on a server

See [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md). In outline:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
python -m phantom_qa.manage gen-secret          # PHANTOMQA_SECRET_KEY
python -m phantom_qa.manage set-password        # user login
python -m phantom_qa.manage set-admin-password  # delete + validate
python -m phantom_qa.manage check               # must exit 0
gunicorn -c gunicorn.conf.py phantom_qa.webapp.main:app
```

## Access levels

| Level | Credential | Permitted actions |
|---|---|---|
| **User** | login password | Upload, run the wizard, edit labels, read reports, verify integrity, export |
| **Admin** | additionally the administrator password | Delete an analysis, validate one |

The administrator password is entered per action rather than at sign-in, so an
administrator works as an ordinary user and supplies it only when deleting or
signing off.

## What to upload

| Input | Support |
|---|---|
| DICOM file (PACS or CD export, JPEG-Lossless included) | Preferred — full precision, metadata, protocol signature |
| Zipped DICOM CD export | Every DICOM image inside is found automatically |
| JPG or PNG | Accepted but marked *reduced precision*: 8-bit lossy, no metadata, scale from phantom geometry only. Excluded from baselines |

You never transcribe numbers from a DICOM viewer — the application reads the
pixel data and metadata directly.

## Phantom definition

`data/phantom_definitions/msf_v1.json` holds each object's position in the
phantom's own millimetre coordinate system, calibrated from six reference scans
covering three orientations. Its `provenance` section records how each value was
obtained.

Three points matter when reading it:

- **Line-pair blocks are measured in every scan.** The stored positions are
  search seeds only, so small differences between phantom units are absorbed
  automatically.
- **The reference set contains two different phantom units.** Their internal
  features sit up to 12 mm apart and their strip angles differ by about 2°. The
  stored values are the mean of the two, so they are not design intent.
- **A substantially different build needs its own definition.** Runtime
  measurement handles a few millimetres of variation, not a different layout.
  A phantom whose resolution strip runs in the opposite frequency order, or
  which has a different number of groups, will be found but mislabelled. See
  [docs/MAINTENANCE.md](docs/MAINTENANCE.md#a-phantom-that-differs-from-the-definition).

`nominal_side_mm` (300.0) is an assumed design dimension; no drawing was
available. Measured side lengths are 299.3–300.4 mm.

## Known limitations

- The viewer displays a downscaled rendering; all measurements are made on the
  full-resolution data.
- **Automatic placement is seeded from the stored phantom definition.** On a
  different phantom build some patterns will be placed wrongly. Every ROI can be
  moved and rotated by hand — and the low-contrast block as a whole, by dragging
  it, setting its angle, or clicking its four corners — with the measurement
  following it. For a build you use regularly, calibrate its own definition.
- **The millimetre scale comes from the printed 5 mm ruler marks.** A ruler
  whose marks are not evenly spaced is excluded from the scale and named in the
  results; with fewer than two usable rulers the scale cannot be cross-checked
  and the dimensions are reported as indicative.
- Field-edge detection requires a visible collimation edge. Where the phantom
  nearly fills the detector, the test reports "not measurable" rather than
  guessing.
- The wedge response is not linear by design of the phantom, so R² is a shape
  descriptor rather than a pass criterion. See
  [docs/ALGORITHMS.md](docs/ALGORITHMS.md).
- One shared user login and one administrator password; there are no per-user
  accounts. The approver's name on a validation is typed, not authenticated.
- `data/uploads/` holds the original scans. These are phantom images, but the
  DICOM headers still carry institution and device fields — treat the directory
  as sensitive.
