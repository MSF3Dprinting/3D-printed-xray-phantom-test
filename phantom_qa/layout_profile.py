"""The confirmed measuring-point layout of one physical phantom.

Why this exists
---------------
Two phantoms built to the same drawing are not the same object. On the MSF
reference scans the printed internal features sit up to ~12 mm apart between
two builds, while repeat scans of ONE build reproduce to a few tenths of a
millimetre. That difference is assembly, not drift: it is a property of the
phantom and it does not change over time. So once an operator has corrected
the measuring points for a phantom, the correction is worth keeping and
replaying on the next scan of that same phantom instead of being re-done by
hand every time.

What is stored, and why it survives a rotated phantom
-----------------------------------------------------
Only phantom-frame millimetres. Registration resolves the phantom's own frame
from the eight possible corner assignments (four rotations x mirror) using the
phantom's asymmetric content, so a scan taken with the phantom turned 90 deg on
the table lands on the same mm coordinates — measured agreement is <= 0.1 mm
for the uniformity, wedge and line-pair objects. Every ``*_px`` field, by
contrast, is a product of THIS scan's transform, so none of them are stored;
they are re-derived with :func:`refresh_px_geometry` when a layout is replayed.

What is deliberately NOT stored
-------------------------------
* field edges — collimation is a property of the exposure, not the phantom, and
  the side names are phantom-frame while the collimator is not;
* ruler probes, corner marks and every ``detected`` / ``measured`` flag — those
  are the per-scan evidence the operator reads in Stage B;
* anything that failed to propose on the source scan.

The 180-degree trap
-------------------
A layout is applied ON TOP of a fresh automatic proposal, never instead of one.
That matters: applying it blind would bypass exactly the detection whose
failures reveal a mis-registered scan. Uniformity and the corner dimensions
cannot detect an orientation error at all (five symmetric squares, four
symmetric sides), and the low-contrast block angle is only defined modulo 180,
which maps circle L1 to within 1 mm of L5. :func:`layout_agrees` compares the
stored layout against the same scan's own proposal on the objects that ARE
orientation-sensitive, and refuses the replay when they disagree.
