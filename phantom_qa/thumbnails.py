"""Small straightened pictures of each test area, for comparing scans by eye.

The comparison report answered "how do these scans differ?" with charts and
numbers only. The field asked to see the images themselves side by side ("in
comparative scans we also want to visually compare the images"), and a
picture of each test area is what makes a number that moved believable — or
shows at a glance that the phantom, not the detector, is what differs.

Every picture is sampled in the PHANTOM frame through the registration
transform rather than cut out of the image. A phantom exposed at 0, 90 or 180
degrees, or face down, therefore comes out the same way up, and one region
lines up column after column. That is the whole point of putting them in a
table.

Five regions per scan:

  phantom      the whole face, for orientation and gross problems
  linepairs    a corridor along the strip through the groups' design
               positions, sampled finely enough to show the lines
  wedge        the step column laid on its side, S1 at the left
  lowcontrast  the flattened close-up already used in the marking step
  uniformity   the five squares side by side, sharing one window

Each picture is encoded with its own generous window, and that window travels
with it. The page can then re-map every picture in a row onto one shared
window in the browser, so a brighter picture really is brighter, without a
second copy of anything crossing the link.

The pictures depend only on the scan, its registration and the low-contrast
block placement, so they are rendered once and kept on disk — see
:func:`pictures_for`.
