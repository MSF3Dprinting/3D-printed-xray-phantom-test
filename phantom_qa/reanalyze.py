"""Recompute stored analyses from the source files the app already keeps.

The point: **you never have to re-upload anything.** Every analysis keeps its
original file under ``data/uploads/``, so when the algorithm or the phantom
definition improves, the stored results can be brought up to date in place.

Two modes, because they answer different questions:

``results``  recompute the numbers from the geometry the user already confirmed.
             Manual ROI adjustments are preserved. This is what you want after
             an ALGORITHM change.
``full``     re-detect the phantom and all ROIs, then compute. Manual
             adjustments are discarded. This is what you want after a PHANTOM
             DEFINITION change.

Labels, validation, baseline flag and the audit trail are always preserved.
Analyses that an administrator has signed off are skipped unless explicitly
included — re-running changes numbers somebody put their name to.
