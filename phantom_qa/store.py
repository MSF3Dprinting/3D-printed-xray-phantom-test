"""SQLite persistence for analyses, plus flat metric export.

One row per analysis. The original upload bytes are kept on disk

Two side tables hang off it:

``geometry_history``  one compressed snapshot per measuring-point edit, so

                      having to re-upload the scan.
``phantom_profiles``  the confirmed measuring-point layout of ONE physical
                      phantom, keyed by its operator-typed label. Stored in
                      phantom-frame millimetres, which is why it replays
                      correctly onto a scan where the phantom lay at a
                      different angle on the detector.
